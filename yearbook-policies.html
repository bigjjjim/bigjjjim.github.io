            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>90s Yearbook AI Headshot</strong> developed by Hbrothers L.L.C. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your data is protected. This policy details the data collection, usage, and protection practices for our app.</p>

        <!-- Data Collection -->
        <section>
            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>For the core functionality of the app, we require 12 selfies. We collect and process these images to deliver our service as described below.</p>

        <!-- Use of Data -->
        <section>
            <h2>Use of Collected Face Data</h2>
            <p>The 12 selfies are used to develop a deep learning model, deploying the "dreambooth" technique, to curate characters featuring the user’s face. This model is created and deployed once for each user to facilitate the app’s features.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Storage</h2>
            <p>We collaborate with "replicate.com" to generate models and predictions. Any output created by replicate.com is deleted after one hour, and all user data are stored privately. The results showcased to users are securely stored on our servers.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

Please note that while we aim to remove data immediately, residual backups might contain information for a brief period due to technical and legal constraints.</p>
